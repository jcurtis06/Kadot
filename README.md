Kodot, a Godot-inspired Kotlin game engine
</h1>

### About
[RidgeRider7](https://github.com/RidgeRider7) and I created [Jadot](https://github.com/jcurtis06/Jadot), a unorganized game engine destined for failure. After abandoning Jadot, we decided to remake the engine, but with Kotlin instead. The code found in Kodot is much cleaner, although still imperfect. Performance is far beyond Jadot as new discoveries were made about Swing.

### Plans
In the near future, I'd like to switch to OpenGL for rendering. Other than that, there isn't much planned.
